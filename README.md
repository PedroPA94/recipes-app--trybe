This app allows the user to search for food or drink recipes, share them, add them to the favorites list and, most importantly, cook/prepare recipes. Each recipe page includes a list of all the necessary ingredients, a video tutorial, and the recipe itself.

## About

This was a group project developed while studying Front-end web development [@betrybe](https://github.com/betrybe). This was the final project for the Front-end certificate. The group got an approval of 100% on this project's requirements.

By using agile methodologies, mainly SCRUM and kanban, the group got into a very good workflow and we were able to finish the project three days before the deadline. This allowed us to focus on the app design and also refactor our code. Together, we prototyped the app with Figma and then went on to styling the app with pure CSS. 

This application uses [theMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) and [theCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) APIs. 

All the files we worked on are in the ```/src``` folder.

<b>Important:</b> the app was developed in a resolution of 360x640. It may not be compatible with different sizes.
